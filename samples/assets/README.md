# Sample Assets

These are assets that can be quickly used in the samples or test projects. 
The PDN files provided are [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/) files,
and the PNG files are exported images from those. The settings used for
export are:

* 8bpp colour
* No dithering
* Transparency threshold at 254 (any pixel 254 or lower is transparent)
* Some layers hidden (depends on the image)

The images have been formulated such that using them in one project
should not hit the restriction on the number of colours usable in one scene.
